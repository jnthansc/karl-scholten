## Required Files

After downloading, you need to convert the TTF files to web formats and place them here with these names:

- `koliko-regular.woff2` (or `koliko-regular.ttf` as fallback)
- `koliko-regular.woff` (optional, for better browser support)
- `koliko-light.woff2` (or `koliko-light.ttf` as fallback)
- `koliko-light.woff` (optional)
- `koliko-bold.woff2` (or `koliko-bold.ttf` as fallback)
- `koliko-bold.woff` (optional)

## Converting TTF to WOFF2 (Recommended)

For best performance, convert TTF files to WOFF2 format using:
- Online tool: https://cloudconvert.com/ttf-to-woff2
- Or command line: `woff2_compress filename.ttf`

The font will work with TTF files, but WOFF2 provides better compression and faster loading.
